# Welcome to the Primate's Test Task for Front End Developers!

This project serves as an assessment of your skills and provides an opportunity to showcase your abilities.

## Task Description

Your task will focus on HTML and CSS (SCSS) and will involve working with the project structure and using GitHub. You will be assessed on your knowledge of working with design files.

The task is to add heading and listing components to the project. For the heading component, you need to write semantic HTML structure along with CSS styles that match the provided designs. For the listing component, the HTML structure is already provided, so focus on the CSS styles and make changes only if necessary.

## Getting Started

To start the project, you will need a package manager such as npm, yarn, pnpm, etc. Follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Run the project: `pnpm start`

## Note

This project uses the `@primate-inc/mono` package, which provides helpful utilities for working with SCSS and Figma. You are encouraged to explore and leverage this package during your development process.

Examples of how to use this package can be found within this project. For more information, you can also visit the package repository at [https://github.com/primate-inc/mono](https://github.com/primate-inc/mono).
